HOW TO INTEGRATE YOUR REAL ADSTERRA ADS:

1. Banners:
In App.tsx, replace the <AdPlaceholder /> components with your real Adsterra scripts.
Example of script integration in React:
Use `useEffect` to dynamically inject the <script> tags provided by Adsterra into the containers.

2. Pop-unders:
Go to your Adsterra dashboard, copy the "Pop-under" code.
In the AdsterraPopupLogic component in App.tsx, use the following code:
useEffect(() => {
    const script = document.createElement('script');
    script.src = '//your-adsterra-link.js';
    script.async = true;
    document.body.appendChild(script);
}, []);

3. Social Bar:
The "Social Bar" is very effective for mobile traffic. Integrate it the same way as the Pop-under.

4. AdBlock Detection:
The current code uses a "Bait" method. If an adblocker is active, it prevents the download button from becoming active and shows an overlay.
Make sure to test with and without a blocker to verify the behavior.
